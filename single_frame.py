Write a function for a single frame:
--Go around the singularity in a circle of a given radius and
plot the value of the phase--

--Also make a plot of the circle, like on the right
(actually, it would be better to indicate the individual pixels
instead of drawing an ideal circle)

--Background: in some systems, the phase jump can be less than 2pi
